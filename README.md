# IR Receiver Module

#### Project Overview

The IR Receiver Module project demonstrates how to interface an IR receiver module with an Arduino Nano to decode and display IR signals. This project is useful for various applications where remote control functionality is needed, such as home automation, robotics, and custom remote control systems. The IR receiver captures the signals sent from an IR remote control and displays the decoded data via the serial monitor.

#### Components Needed

1. **Arduino Nano**
2. **IR Receiver Module**
3. **Jumper Wires**
4. **IR Remote Control**

### Block Diagram



#### Circuit Setup

1. **Connect IR Receiver Module to Arduino Nano:**
   - Connect the signal pin of the IR receiver module to digital pin 2 on the Arduino Nano.
   - Connect the VCC pin of the IR receiver module to the 5V pin on the Arduino Nano.
   - Connect the GND pin of the IR receiver module to any ground (GND) pin on the Arduino Nano.

#### Instructions

1. **Circuit Setup:**
   - Wire the IR receiver module to the Arduino Nano as described in the circuit setup section.

2. **Code Upload:**
   - Connect the Arduino Nano to your computer via USB.
   - Open the Arduino IDE and paste the provided code.
   - Upload the code to the Arduino Nano.

3. **Testing:**
   - Once the code is uploaded, open the serial monitor.
   - Point an IR remote control at the receiver module and press any button.
   - The serial monitor will display the received IR code in hexadecimal format.

#### Applications

- **Home Automation:** Control various devices in your home using an IR remote.
- **Robotics:** Use the IR remote to send commands to a robot.
- **Custom Remote Control Systems:** Develop custom remote control interfaces for different projects.

#### Notes

- Ensure the IR receiver is oriented correctly to receive signals from the remote control.
- Experiment with different remotes and IR codes to understand the range and compatibility of your IR receiver module.
- Use the decoded IR codes to trigger specific actions in your projects, such as turning on LEDs, controlling motors, or activating relays.
